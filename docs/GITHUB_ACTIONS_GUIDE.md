## What is CI/CD?

### CI - Continuous Integration

**Continuous Integration** means automatically testing your code every time you make changes.

**Example without CI:**
```
1. You write code
2. You push to GitHub
3. Someone else pulls your code
4. Their Unity project breaks! üí•
5. Hours wasted finding the bug
```

**Example with CI:**
```
1. You write code
2. You push to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions automatically runs tests
4. You get instant feedback: ‚úÖ Pass or ‚ùå Fail
5. Fix bugs BEFORE anyone else sees them!
```

### CD - Continuous Deployment/Delivery

**Continuous Deployment** means automatically releasing your code when it's ready.

**Example without CD:**
```
1. You finish a feature
2. You manually create a release
3. You manually write changelog
4. You manually tag the version
5. You manually upload package
6. This takes 30+ minutes! üòì
```

**Example with CD:**
```
1. You finish a feature
2. Merge to main branch
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Creates release
   - Generates changelog
   - Tags version
   - Uploads package
4. All in under 5 minutes! üéâ
```

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is GitHub's built-in automation system. Think of it as robots that work for you 24/7!

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Workflow
A workflow is a YAML file that defines automation tasks.

**Location**: `.github/workflows/*.yml`

**Example**: `development.yml` runs tests when you push code

#### 2. Trigger (on:)
Defines WHEN the workflow runs.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - development  # Run when pushing to development
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - development  # Run when creating PR to development
```

**Common Triggers:**
- `push` - When you push commits
- `pull_request` - When you create/update a PR
- `schedule` - Run on a schedule (e.g., daily)
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual trigger from GitHub UI

#### 3. Job
A job is a set of steps that run on the same machine.

```yaml
jobs:
  test-unity-package:  # Job ID
    name: üß™ Run Unity Tests  # Display name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest     # What OS to use
    steps:
      # Steps go here
```

**Key Points:**
- Jobs run in PARALLEL by default (faster!)
- Each job gets a fresh virtual machine
- Jobs can depend on other jobs (`needs:`)

#### 4. Step
A step is a single task within a job.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: üì• Checkout Code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Use a pre-made action

  - name: üéÆ Run Tests
    run: echo "Running tests"  # Run a shell command
```

**Two Types of Steps:**
1. **Action** (`uses:`) - Pre-made reusable component
2. **Script** (`run:`) - Custom shell commands

#### 5. Runner
A runner is the virtual machine that executes your workflow.

**Available Runners:**
- `ubuntu-latest` - Linux (fastest, cheapest)
- `windows-latest` - Windows
- `macos-latest` - macOS

**For Unity packages, use**: `ubuntu-latest` (required by GameCI)

#### 6. Secrets
Secrets are encrypted environment variables for sensitive data.

**Example:**
```yaml
env:
  UNITY_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_EMAIL }}
  UNITY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PASSWORD }}
  UNITY_SERIAL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_SERIAL }}
```

## Understanding Our Workflows

### 1. Development Workflow (`development.yml`)

**Purpose**: Run tests on every push to `development` branch

**When it runs:**
- You push to `development`
- Someone creates a PR to `development`

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks out your code
2. ‚úÖ Caches Unity Library (for speed)
3. ‚úÖ Runs Unity tests (EditMode + PlayMode)
4. ‚úÖ Validates package.json
5. ‚úÖ Checks required files exist
6. ‚úÖ Uploads test results

**Time**: ~2-5 minutes (first run: ~10 min, cached: ~2 min)

**View Results**: GitHub Actions tab ‚Üí "Development Branch Tests"

### 2. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automatically create releases when merging to `main`

**When it runs:**
- You push to `main` (e.g., merge development ‚Üí main)
- You push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Reads version from package.json
2. ‚úÖ Generates changelog from commits
3. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release
4. ‚úÖ Creates package .zip file
5. ‚úÖ Uploads package to release
6. ‚úÖ Updates CHANGELOG.md

**Time**: ~1-2 minutes

**Result**: Automatic release on GitHub!

### 3. PR Checks Workflow (`pr-checks.yml`)

**Purpose**: Quality gates before merging ANY pull request

**When it runs:**
- Someone creates a PR
- New commits are pushed to PR

**What it does:**
1. ‚ö° **Quick Checks** (runs first, fast!)
   - Validate package.json format
   - Check version format
   - Verify required files exist
   - Check for .meta files
   - Look for forbidden patterns

2. üß™ **Unity Tests** (runs after quick checks)
   - Run all Unity tests
   - Generate coverage report
   - Post results as PR comment

3. üìù **Code Quality**
   - Check C# naming conventions
   - Validate assembly definitions
   - Check for license headers

4. üìã **Summary**
   - Overall pass/fail status

**Time**: ~3-7 minutes

**Result**: PR can only merge if ALL checks pass!

## Setting Up Unity License

GitHub Actions needs a Unity license to run your tests. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Personal License (Recommended for Open Source)

#### Step 1: Get Activation File

1. Create `.github/workflows/get-license.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Get Unity License
   on: workflow_dispatch
   jobs:
     get-license:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: game-ci/unity-request-activation-file@v2
         - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
           with:
             name: Unity_v2022.3.alf
             path: Unity_v2022.3.alf
   ```

2. Push this file to GitHub
3. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Get Unity License" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
4. Download the `.alf` file from artifacts

#### Step 2: Generate License File

1. Go to https://license.unity3d.com/manual
2. Upload your `.alf` file
3. Select "Unity Personal" (free for open source)
4. Download the `.ulf` license file

#### Step 3: Add to GitHub Secrets

1. Open your `.ulf` file in a text editor
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Go to GitHub: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add these secrets:
   - Name: `UNITY_LICENSE`, Value: [paste entire .ulf contents]
   - Name: `UNITY_EMAIL`, Value: [your Unity email]
   - Name: `UNITY_PASSWORD`, Value: [your Unity password]
   - Name: `UNITY_SERIAL`, Value: [leave empty for Personal]

#### Step 4: Update Workflows

Your workflows are already configured! But verify they use:
```yaml
env:
  UNITY_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.UNITY_EMAIL }}
  UNITY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PASSWORD }}
  UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
```

#### Step 5: Test

1. Push a commit to `development`
2. Go to Actions tab
3. Watch your first workflow run! üéâ

### Option 2: Professional License

If you have Unity Pro or Plus:

1. Get your serial key from Unity Dashboard
2. Add to GitHub Secrets:
   - Name: `UNITY_EMAIL`, Value: [your email]
   - Name: `UNITY_PASSWORD`, Value: [your password]
   - Name: `UNITY_SERIAL`, Value: [your serial key]

3. Update workflows to use `UNITY_SERIAL` instead of `UNITY_LICENSE`

### Troubleshooting License Issues

**Error: "Invalid license"**
- Regenerate `.ulf` file
- Ensure entire `.ulf` contents copied to secret
- Check expiration date

**Error: "Too many activations"**
- Unity Personal allows 2 activations
- Deactivate old builds: Unity Hub ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Licenses ‚Üí Deactivate

**Error: "License expired"**
- Personal licenses expire yearly
- Regenerate following Step 1-3 above

## Monitoring Workflows

### Where to View Workflows

1. **GitHub Repository** ‚Üí **Actions tab**
2. You'll see:
   - Workflow runs (left sidebar)
   - Run history (main area)
   - Status badges (‚úÖ passing, ‚ùå failing)

### Understanding Workflow Status

#### ‚úÖ Success
```
‚úÖ Development Branch Tests
   All tests passed! Code is good to merge.
```

#### ‚ùå Failure
```
‚ùå Development Branch Tests
   Some tests failed. Click to see details.
```

#### üü° In Progress
```
üü° Development Branch Tests
   Workflow is currently running...
```

#### ‚ö´ Cancelled
```
‚ö´ Development Branch Tests
   Workflow was cancelled (newer run started)
```

### Viewing Detailed Logs

1. Click on a workflow run
2. Click on a job (e.g., "üß™ Run Unity Tests")
3. Expand steps to see detailed logs
4. Look for red ‚ùå marks indicating errors

### Downloading Artifacts

Some workflows save files (test results, coverage reports):

1. Go to workflow run
2. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
3. Click to download (e.g., "Test Results.zip")

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Unity test runner failed"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Test execution failed with exit code 1
```

**Causes:**
- Test failures in your code
- Unity version mismatch
- Missing dependencies

**Solutions:**
1. Run tests locally first: Unity ‚Üí Window ‚Üí General ‚Üí Test Runner
2. Check Unity version matches workflow (2022.3)
3. View detailed logs in Actions tab
4. Fix failing tests and push again

#### 2. "Package validation failed"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Missing required files
```

**Causes:**
- Missing package.json
- Missing .asmdef files
- Missing .meta files

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.github/workflows/development.yml` ‚Üí "Check Required Files"
2. Ensure all required files exist
3. Commit missing files

#### 3. "Workflow doesn't trigger"

**Symptoms:**
- Push code but workflow doesn't run

**Causes:**
- Wrong branch (workflow set for `development`, you pushed to `main`)
- Workflow file syntax error
- `.github/workflows/` path incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Check you pushed to correct branch
2. Validate YAML syntax: https://www.yamllint.com/
3. Verify path: `.github/workflows/development.yml` (exactly this!)

#### 4. "Cache restore failed"

**Symptoms:**
```
Warning: Cache restore failed
```

**Causes:**
- First run (no cache yet)
- Cache expired (7 days)
- Cache key changed

**Solutions:**
- This is usually just a warning, not an error
- First run will be slower, future runs cached
- Ignore if workflow still completes

#### 5. "API rate limit exceeded"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: API rate limit exceeded
```

**Causes:**
- Too many workflow runs in short time
- GitHub API limits reached

**Solutions:**
- Wait 1 hour for reset
- Use `concurrency:` to cancel old runs
- Reduce workflow frequency

### Getting Help

1. **Check Workflow Logs** - Most issues show clear error messages
2. **Search Issues** - Look for similar problems in GameCI issues
3. **Ask in Discussions** - Community can help!
4. **Read Documentation** - Links in [Resources](#resources)

## Advanced Topics

### Caching for Speed

**What is caching?**
Caching saves the Unity Library folder between runs, making subsequent runs much faster.

**How it works:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: Library  # What to cache
    key: Library-${{ hashFiles('package.json') }}  # Cache key
    restore-keys: Library-  # Fallback if exact match not found
```

**Cache invalidation:**
- If `package.json` changes, cache is rebuilt
- Caches expire after 7 days of no use
- Manual: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Caches ‚Üí Delete

### Matrix Builds (Testing Multiple Versions)

Test against multiple Unity versions:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    unity-version:
      - 2022.3
      - 2023.1
      - 2023.2

steps:
  - uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v4
    with:
      unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unity-version }}
```

This creates 3 jobs, one for each version!

### Conditional Steps

Run steps only in certain conditions:

```yaml
# Only on main branch
- name: Deploy
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: echo "Deploying..."

# Only if tests passed
- name: Upload Coverage
  if: success()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

# Only if tests failed
- name: Notify Failure
  if: failure()
  run: echo "Tests failed!"

# Always run (even if previous failed)
- name: Cleanup
  if: always()
  run: echo "Cleaning up..."
```

### Workflow Dispatch (Manual Triggers)

Add manual trigger button:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Adds "Run workflow" button in UI
    inputs:
      unity-version:
        description: 'Unity version to use'
        required: true
        default: '2022.3'

jobs:
  manual-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Testing with Unity ${{ inputs.unity-version }}"
```

### Environment Variables

**Set for entire workflow:**
```yaml
env:
  UNITY_VERSION: 2022.3
  PACKAGE_NAME: com.nimrita.flowui

jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run: echo $UNITY_VERSION  # Uses workflow-level env
```

**Set for specific job:**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    env:
      TEST_MODE: all
    steps:
      - run: echo $TEST_MODE  # Uses job-level env
```

**Set for specific step:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Test
    env:
      LOG_LEVEL: debug
    run: echo $LOG_LEVEL  # Uses step-level env
```

### Status Badges

Add status badges to your README:

```markdown
[![Tests](https://github.com/nimritagames/Unity-FlowUI/actions/workflows/development.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nimritagames/Unity-FlowUI/actions/workflows/development.yml)
```
